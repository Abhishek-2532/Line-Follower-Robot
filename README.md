# Line Follower Robot
A line follower robot is a type of robot designed to follow a path, usually a black line on a white surface (or a white line on a black surface). It does this using sensors (typically infrared sensors) that detect the contrast between the line and the surrounding surface.

## Components Used in Line Follower Robot
* Arduino Uno
* IR sensor
* L293D motor driver
* BO motor
* Wheels
* Lithium-ion battery
* Jumper cables
* Embedded C ( upload code in Arduino)
